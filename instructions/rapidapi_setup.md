# Setting up Rapid API

For this project we'll be taking zillow data from RapidAPI. Specifically, from [Zillow RapidAPI](https://rapidapi.com/s.mahmoud97/api/zillow56/). 

> You can use any API that you are comfortable with. But make changes accordingly while extracting the data.

1. Create a [RapidAPI account](https://rapidapi.com/hub) and login.
2. Navigate [here](https://rapidapi.com/s.mahmoud97/api/zillow56/) to get to the exact zillow source. 
3. Go to Pricing and Subscribe to the Basic (free) object.
4. In the Endpoints section, one the right side you can select the language of choice (in our case it would be python) and check the code snippets to see how to connect to this API.
